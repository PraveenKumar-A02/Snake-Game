*Overview*

The Snake Game is a popular arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats food, and grows longer. 
The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body while consuming as much food as possible.
This repository provides a simple implementation of the game using Python and the Pygame library.
It's a great project for learning game development and programming fundamentals.

*Features*

 * Classic Snake Game mechanics
 * Pygame-based graphical interface
 * Real-time game updates
 * Scoring system
 * Responsive controls

*Installation*

To run the Snake Game, you'll need Python and Pygame installed on your machine. 


***Usage***

To start the Snake Game, run the following command:

bash:

 * python main.py


Use the arrow keys to control the snake:

 --> Up Arrow: Move Up
 --> Down Arrow: Move Down
 --> Left Arrow: Move Left
 --> Right Arrow: Move Right
 
The game will display your score and end when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
